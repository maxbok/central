Simple IoT project to control lights from different devices such as a local hosted website, an iOS app or sensors.

Each connected device will be equipped with an Atmega328P and a NRF24L01.  
The NRF24L01 is used to communicate with the server.

A RaspberryPi will be used as the server and will also be connected to a NRF24L01 to receive and send messages to the devices.  
The server will also provide actions and info of the connected devices.

# Communication

NRF24L01 with mesh.

Devices will ping the server every seconds with their current state: battery, intensityâ€¦

# Devices

Atmega328P and a NRF24L01 powered by a battery.
